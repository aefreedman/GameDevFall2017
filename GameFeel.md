# Game Feel in 15 Minutes

Adapted from _Game Feel_ by Steve Swink

## What is Game Feel?

Game feel is a term that video game designers use to describe the qualities of games as it relates to the game's reaction to a player's input. For example, you might describe a game's feel as sluggish or muddy, opposed to responsive or fluid. As a game designer, when you're attempting to create good game feel, you may implement a variety of techniques that enable your players to experience the game in the way that you intend.

In _Game Feel_ Steve Swink defines game feel as
> Real-time control of virtual objects in a simulated space, with interactions emphasized by polish.

He also provides a corrollary that definies _good_ feeling games as those that provide the following five experiences to the player
> - The aesthetic sensation of control
> - The pleasure of learning, practicing and mastering a skill
> - Extension of the senses
> - Extension of identity
> - Interaction with a unique physical reality within the game

Important considerations when using Steve Swink's definition of game feel:
- Not all games have game feel, e.g. turn-based games or text-based games
- Not all games have game feel at all times

For this class, we're only going to focus on Steve's basic definition, which is more than enough to get you started. Additionally, I prefer to evaluate game feel in a relative way, rather than a proscriptive way, as Steve does.

For me, a good feeling game is one in which every element of the game is coordinated to provide and experience that matches the player's expectations.

## The Building Blocks

Steve's definition points out three building blocks of game feel:

- Real-time control
- Simulated space
- Polish

Real-time control means that a player's input should elicit a reaction from the game as quickly as possible so that the player percieves that their input has an effect on the game. Simulated space for Steve is the simulated environment that enabled the player to experience the effects of their input on the game. Polish is all of the additional work, like art, sound, or animations that help sell the perception of real-time control in a simulated space.

## Exercise

In groups of three, pick a game that you can all play right now (it will probably be mobile or web). Play it for about five minutes, and then evaluate the game's real-time control, simulated space, and polish. Finally, determine whether the game has "true" game feel, according to Steve. (A game with true game feel exhibits all three building blocks of game feel.)
